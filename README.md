Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm a Full-Stack Developer with a passion for turning complex challenges into smooth, efficient solutions. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, enabling me to build comprehensive and effective applications.

ðŸŒŸ **About Me** ðŸŒŸ

I grew up in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and lived there until I was 21. Afterward, I moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I not only learned Spanish but also gained valuable experience in a software factory and with the Mulesoft B2B development team. My journey then led me to London, a dream destination for me to improve my English and experience life in the vibrant UK. Currently, I am in the UK under a Skilled Working Visa, aiming for a career in Data/Machine Learning Engineering. In my personal time, I enjoy training for marathons, delving into personal development books, and I'm keen to revisit music study as a long-term personal goal.

ðŸ’¡ **My Philosophy** ðŸ’¡

"Imagination, consistent action, and discipline can move mountains." This mantra guides me through the ever-evolving landscape of technology and life. I believe in dreaming big, taking bold steps, and maintaining a disciplined approach to achieve excellence.

- Front-end: React, Angular
- Back-end: Node.js, PHP, Java, Golang
- Mobile: Flutter/Dart
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

ðŸš€ Projects:
