**About me**

I’m a Full-Stack Software Developer with over 10 years of experience building e-commerce platforms, cloud systems, and integrations that help businesses grow. 🚀

I’ve worked with PHP, Java/Scala, and JavaScript on the job, and I love tinkering with Python, Golang, and building [mobile apps with Flutter](https://apkpure.com/aipetto/com.aipetto) in my personal projects. 💻 I enjoy creating software that runs smoothly, saves costs, and delights users.

I have hands-on experience with AWS and Google Cloud, keeping apps fast and reliable. ☁️
I’ve lived and worked in São Paulo, Buenos Aires, and now London, which has helped me appreciate different markets and cultures. 🌎 I’m fluent in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, so I can collaborate easily with teams worldwide. 🤝

I love being part of agile teams that have open communication and quick feedback loops. 🔄 If you’re looking for a developer to build software that boosts your business, let’s connect and make it happen together! ✨
