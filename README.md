Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm a Full-Stack Developer passionate about turning complex challenges into reality. 

ðŸŒŸ **About me** ðŸŒŸ

I grew up in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and lived there until I was 21. Afterwards, I moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where I learned Spanish and gained valuable experience in different roles at a software factory and working on the Mulesoft B2B development team. 

My journey then led me to London, a dream destination for me to improve my English and experience life in the vibrant UK. 

Currently, I am in the UK working as a Full-Stack Developer, aiming for a career in Data/Machine Learning Engineering. 

In my time, I enjoy training for marathons, reading personal development books, and studying music as a long-term personal goal.

ðŸ’¡ **Philosophy** ðŸ’¡

"Imagination, consistent action, and discipline can move mountains." I believe in dreaming big, learning through the journey, and maintaining a disciplined approach to achieving my goals.

ðŸ”¨ **Stack**

- Front-end: Javascript, React, Next.js
- Back-end: Node.js, PHP, Java, Golang, Python
- Mobile: Flutter/Dart
- Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Cloud: Google Cloud, AWS
- Project Management Tools: Jira, Breeze

ðŸš€ **Projects**

I enjoy working on diverse web applications contributing to both frontend and backend systems.

I utilise agile methods for adaptable, iterative development, and emphasise teamwork with a focus on open communication and shared responsibilities.
